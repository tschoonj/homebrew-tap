# Tom Schoonjans' personal Homebrew tap

This personal Homebrew repository provides Formulas for several software packages I am working on that are too obscure for the official Homebrew taps for now.

For general information on Homebrew, consult the [official website](http://brew.sh)

## Usage

First, add this tap to your Brew. This will to clone Pivotal tap repository and symlink all its formulae.

    brew tap tschoonj/tap

Now you will be able to work on those formulae as if there were in canonical Homebrew repository:

    brew install gtkmm-plplot

    brew install easyrng
